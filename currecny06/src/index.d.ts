/*
  An interface defines the shape (structure) of an object.
In simple words:
  It tells TypeScript what properties an object must have and their types.

  
  implements forces a class to follow the structure defined by an interface.
In simple words:
  “If a class says it implements an interface, it MUST provide everything the interface describes.”
