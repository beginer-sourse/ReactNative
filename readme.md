Basic App (Awesome01):
  In this I learned about the basic file structure of React Native. I explored App.tsx and AppPro.tsx. I learned how to use core components like SafeAreaView, View, Text, and Button. I also learned about StyleSheet for styling and conditional rendering using useColorScheme to handle Dark and Light modes.

Cards :
  First Awesome02 app is related to style sheet and and other function like scrollarea View and Text etc. what i Learned FlexBox. and components like View, Text, touchability, scrolView and scrolBar, safeAreView.

Password Genrator:
  Second App  Awesome03 is based on building Password genration in this we learned formik, touchablity,  UseSate and bouncyCheckBox others how to use functions.
  we used useState to update the BoucyCheckBox and used values of formik to genreate new password of lowercase,UpperCase,numbers and sybol


BackGround Changer:
  Third App Awsome04 is based on backgoroundColor of app. that changes the color of app randomly when we used useState change hexa value of the background.


Roll The Dice 
  In this what i learned is how to create a componemt and render it by taking parameter of Image use ImageUrl of <ImageSourcePropType> by using <propsWithChildren> and destructure it in the component to use in component. why useState and functions should be under app function because if hooks and function outside the scope of the function then they can't render when state is changed, and if they are oustide the scope then every user see same thing. also learned haptic feedback that occurs in app like vibration from phone when we click on button.
  I also learned how to generate random colors for the background and shapes using a helper function and applied them using useState. Additionally, I used the Pressable component to handle user interactions.

Currency Converter:
  In this App (Currency06), I learned how to build a currency converter. I used the 'react-native-snackbar' library to provide feedback (toasts) when inputs are invalid. I managed multiple states using useState for the input amount, result, and target currency. I also learned to create a reusable component (CurrencyComp) and passed data to it using props defined with TypeScript interfaces. I implemented logic to validate numeric input and format the outputResult.

Tic-Tak-To
  In this app we used array logic , Snackbar and fontAwesome6 Icons for circle and cross. and all the remaing that are used in all previous apps.
